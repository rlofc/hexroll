Mountains:
  Name: Mountains
  Flair:
    - A thundering waterfall drops hundreds of feet down from an overhang in the
      steep slopes, forming a cloud of raging water at the base. 

    - A giant peak stands taller than any of the mountains around it. An eerie
      red glow can be seen around its top.

    - Waterfalls of lava flows from cracks in a cliff, melting pieces of rock as
      they go down into a river of inferno in the deep canyon.

    - The skeleton of a huge dragon was fossilised in one of the cliff faces
      here. Its wings are spread as if it was about to fly into the sky once
      again.

    - Multiple plateaus separated by seemingly bottomless chasms are connected
      with fragile rope bridges.  The strong wind swings the brides from side to
      side, making crossing them a terrifying experience.

    - Giant boulders are hanging in mid air by some kind of invisible magic.
      Some have rope ladders attached, reaching all the way down for anyone to
      climb.

    - A small patch of dark clouds circle an even darker peak.  Jolts of
      lightnings flash from within, followed by rumbling thunders.

    - The narrow and winding trails here are on the faces of the cliffs.
      Carelessness or combat are especially risky here.

    - The passages here are surrounded with steep vertical cliffs and are
      branching to all directions like a fragmented maze.
      

  Location:
    - on the edge of the cliffs, at the end of a winding steep trail
    - high in the mountains
    - across a seemingly bottomless chasm, where a rope bridge meets an overhang
    - near the base of a steep cliff
    - near the base of the tallest mountain

  Hideout:
    - behind a waterfall
    - inside a cave on the cliff
    - inside an old volcano


Forest:
  Name: Forest
  Flair:
    - Giant red, purple and blue mushrooms grow beside the trees here, their
      colors are vibrant and bright, much like gem stones.

    - The trees here are naked and twisted. Their branches reach down like bony
      claws. Was this place cursed in days long gone?

    - So big and tall are the trees here. Their tops are almost hidden by the
      dense mist.  Their trunks are as wide as a hut. Some of them have planks
      of wood attached, forming a ladder.

    - A huge, lush tree is standing in a clearing here, covered with colorful
      flowers and holding a sweet berry inside. Birds fly cheerfully around it.

    - Moss covered ruins of an ancient stone structure emerge from within the
      vegetation. Carvings of spirals and swirls decorate some of the larger
      stones.

    - The forest is dense and dark here, but countless clusters of
      phosphorescent fungi are growing near the base of the trunks, creating a
      luminous colorful glow above the ground.

    - Dense ivy and vegetation cover an old dragon skeleton, as if sleeping
      peacefully in a clearing surrounded by the trees. 

    - Ropes tangle down from the branches here. On some of them, humanoid- size
      straw-made figures are hanging by their canvas covered heads.

    - Dozens of giant dead tree trunks are laying on the ground here, covered
      with moss and undergrowth. Some of them seem to have a face, with a 
      frozen expression of agony.

    - !jinja >
      An oversized statue of {{StatusSubject | articlize}} holding a sword against the
      ground stands proudly in a clearing here. Fresh flowers were recently
      placed near its base.

  StatusSubject:
    - warrior
    - king
    - queen

  Location:
    - near a water stream
    - next to a clearing
    - deep in the woods
    - where the woods meet a tall mountain

  Hideout:
    - under the ruins of an ancient city
    - hidden in one of the tree covered hills
    - near an abandoned stronghold, deep in the woods


Coast:
  Name: Coast
  Flair:
    - The ruins of an abandoned lighthouse stand on a rock on the edge of a
      cove, now a temporary home to a flock sea birds.

    - The skeleton of a giant whale emerges above the shallow waves near the
      coastline. Kelp and birds decorate its old and wet bones.

    - An old rotting shipwreck was washed to the sands here, a huge hole, the
      size of a giant tentacle is burst through its hull.

    - The sands here are soft and warm and the turquoise water are crystal
      clear.

    - A giant stone statue of a head was washed ashore here. It seams like it
      was detached from a full statue of a body at the neck.

    - A smoking volcano stands not far form the coastline here.  The lush green
      vegetation that covers it indicates it did not erupt for a while now.

    - Dozens of posts were planted in the sand here. At their tops, the old red
      fabric of what used to be flags still wave against the wind.

    - Tall cliffs separate the sea from the land here. Fierce waves 
      crash against the sharp blackened rocks hundreds of feet down.

    - The coastline here is barricaded with giant boulders, forming a wall
      against the raging waves. It extremely difficult for boats to come in or
      out.

    - An rocky islet is merely a short swim away from the coast here, (or a wet
      walk when the tide is low).

  Location:
    - near the coastline
    - on one of the coastal cliffs
    - near an estuary
    - in a rocky cove

Desert:
  Name: Desert
  Flair:
    - The sand here is as dark as the night. Not a fire nor a vulcano could have
      been the cause.

    - You can clearly see bones revealing under the sand when the wind shifts
      the sand.  This was no land of peace.

    - Surrounded by the soft dunes, a huge rock shaped like a dome is planted in
      the sand. It is almost too slippery to climb on.

    - Either wind or some other force creates dozens of giant sand vortexes
      here, as tall as the eye can see. 

    - There are numerous sinkholes in the sands here. Some of them are big
      enough to swallow an inn.

    - The wind here is gentle and the sand is soft and warm. Large canopied
      desert trees provide enough shadow to rest or camp under.

    - Vast dunes stretch in all directions, shimmering in the desert heat. The
      sun makes the sand scroching hot.

  Location: 
    - on the dunes sands
    - near an oasis
    - between two giant dunes


Plains:
  Name: Plains
  Flair:
    - There are several large craters in the green fields here. Something
      violent must have hit the ground from the sky in the past.

    - Crushed skulls and rusted swords are scattered around the hills here. 
      You can almost hear the noises and screams of the ancient battlefield.

    - a tall stone tower fell and now lay crushed on the ground. A few small
      bunnies run and hide under its stone bricks.

    - A violent earthquake left the ground here cracked with deep and narrow
      chasms. If listening carefully, one can hear eerie sounds coming from 
      deep inside.

    - Several large geysers discharge boiling streams of water and vapour every few
      minutes.

    - A vast field of colorful flowers covers the shallow hills here. Butterflies
      and bees hop from flower to flower.

    - There’s a perfect circle of large stones, each standing tall above
      the ground. In the center, a shallow pit seems to have hosted a bonfire not
      too long ago.

    - A pile of stones form a pyramid of steps, tall enough to provide a better
      vantage point over the region. At its top, a rusted old sword is planted 
      with its blade in the ground.

  Location:
    - in a valley
    - at the top of a hill
    - between two hills
    - on a hill’s slope
    - on the terraced hills
    - in the grasslands
    - atop a rocky hill

  Hideout:
    - behind a waterfall
    - under the ruins of an old fortress
    - inside an oak
